# Computer-Networks-in-GNS3
This contains my exercises for a course in university. They are the configuration files for an GNS 3 topology. 

It was created in GNS 3 using the GNS 3 VM on VM Ware Player

The following appliances are required:

Debian12.4 (terminal)

Cisco C7200 (router)

Mikrotik 7.11.2 (router)

vIOS-L2 (switch)

The files will contain which commands must be inserted in which devices.
